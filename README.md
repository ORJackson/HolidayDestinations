# HolidayDestinations
A program to track details of destinations and allow a user to compare destinations to one another. 

Countries around the world have a host of holiday destinations available to the general public. With the eventual loosening of travel restrictions, these holiday destinations are now starting to open back up and accept tourists. We want to build a portfolio of available locations. 

This java program allows the user to add destinations, track details of destinations, and compare destinations to one another.
